# Spring Boot OAuth2 Example

This application showcases how to secure a Spring Boot REST API using OAuth2 authentication and authorization. It provides examples of integrating with both Keycloak (an open-source identity and access management solution) and Google as OAuth2 providers. The project includes:

- Secure REST endpoints that require authentication.
- Configuration for multiple OAuth2 providers.
- Example usage of user roles and authorities.
- Sample frontend (if applicable) to demonstrate login flows.
- Instructions for running and testing the application locally.
